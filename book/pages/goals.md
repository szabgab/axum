# Goals

* Provide an easy way to see the examples in the axum repository with explanations.
* A way to learn using axum.
* Improve the examples (adding test, filling holes if there are any).
* Adding `README.md` files to the examples.
* The book can be found at [axum.code-maven.com](https://axum.code-maven.com/) with the hope that one day it will be accepted as part of the official axum project
and displayed on a stand-alone axum website or on the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) website.
